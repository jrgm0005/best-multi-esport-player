# best-multi-esport-player

Code challenge to check the best player of e-sport games from a csv with players game stats.

As, initial set of data was wrong. I fixed the one for LOL and worked with that.

## Requeriments

Running composer install

## Checks

1. Index.php

It is as easy as download/fork the repo, run composer install and go to the index.php page in the project when running a PHP server

2. To run tests, it should be as easy as run ./vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit src/tests/ in the project folder.
